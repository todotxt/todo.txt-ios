An iOS application by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org) and [the Todo.txt community](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/) designed to manage your [todo.txt file](http://todotxt.com) stored in [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) (and eventually, other configurable cloud sources).

Dual-licensed under the GPL and the MIT license.

This project is brand new. Interested in joining in? Fork the repository and talk to us on the [Todo.txt CLI mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/).
